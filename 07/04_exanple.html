        <strong><i>HTML</i></strong> elements are the building blocks of <strong><i>HTML</i></strong> pages. With
        <strong><i>HTML</i></strong> constructs, images and
        other
        objects such as
        interactive
        forms may be embedded into the rendered page. <strong><i>HTML</i></strong> provides a means to create structured
        documents by denoting
        structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes, and other items.
        <strong><i>HTML</i></strong> elements
        are
        delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags such as <code>img</code> and <code>input</code> directly
        introduce content into
        the
        page. Other tags such as
        <mark>p and /p</mark> surround and provide information about document text and may include sub-element
        tags. Browsers do not display the <strong><i>HTML</i></strong> tags but use them to interpret the content of the
        page.
